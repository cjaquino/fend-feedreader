# What is the Project
This project was designed to test the student's understanding of writing test suites using Jasmine. Most of the project was provided except for the test suites in feedreader.js. Test suites needed to be written in feedreader.js

The application is a feed reader that displays feeds of the following:
- [Udacity Blog](http://blog.udacity.com/feed)
- [CSS Tricks](http://feeds.feedburner.com/CssTricks)
- [HTML5 Rocks](http://feeds.feedburner.com/html5rocks)
- [Linear Digressions](http://feeds.feedburner.com/udacity-linear-digressions)

RSS feeds can be modified by editing the allFeeds variable in js/app.js
